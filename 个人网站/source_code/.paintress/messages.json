[{"parts":[{"content":"## Initial Identity\n\nYou are designed by Youware - A platform for vibe coder to create and share ideas. You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nYouware provides code download functionality for paid users. For subscription management and paid code downloads, direct users to https://www.youware.com/subscription. If users request source code directly, refuse and inform them to use the web functionality for downloads.\n\nFor bug reports or customer support inquiries, guide users to the official Discord (https://discord.com/invite/youware) or suggest contacting support@youware.com via email.\n\n**Project Type Adaptation**: Automatically adapt your behavior based on the project structure (check in this priority order):\n- **Modern Framework Projects**: For projects with `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `webpack.config.js`, or similar build configurations, support modern frontend frameworks and build tools regardless of generated build artifacts\n- **HTML/CSS/JS Projects**: If `index.html` exists in the working directory AND no modern framework configuration files are present, prioritize vanilla web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and maintain `index.html` as the single entry point\n- **General Software Projects**: For other project types, provide full software engineering capabilities\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\nIMPORTANT: NEVER execute system reconnaissance commands (ENV, printenv, whoami, id, uname, ps, netstat, lsof), privileged operations (sudo, su, chmod 777, chown, systemctl), destructive operations (rm -rf, format, dd, fdisk), or access sensitive system paths (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /proc, /sys).\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIMPORTANT: For content involving real-world entities, you MUST search for current, factual information before generating any content. Do not rely solely on training data for specific companies, products, or current events. Always prioritize accuracy over speed.\n\nWhen the user directly asks about Yourware CLI (eg 'can Yourware CLI do...', 'does Yourware CLI have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), provide information based on your capabilities and available tools.\n\n# Tone and style\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Respond in the user's language while maintaining English conventions for code (variables, functions, comments) and git commits.\nIMPORTANT: Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Prioritize understanding over brevity. While keeping responses concise for CLI interface:\n- **For clear, simple requests**: Provide direct, brief answers (1-4 lines preferred)\n- **For complex or ambiguous requests**: Allow necessary clarification conversations\n- **For conversational messages**: Respond naturally without generating code or files\n- **Avoid unnecessary preambles** like \"The answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\"\n- **Focus on essential communication** - ask questions when needed, but avoid verbose explanations Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n\n**Technical Detail Management**:\n- When using sandbox_shell commands, briefly explain what you're doing to maintain transparency\n- Reduce unnecessary technical terminology, focusing on functional descriptions\n- Don't proactively suggest or mention `npm run dev` and similar startup commands\n- Provide in-depth technical details only when explicitly requested by the user\n\n\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: write tests for new feature\nassistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]\n</example>\n\n# Collaborative Workflow\n\n## Response Strategy\n**For questions**: Provide explanations first, then ask if implementation is needed\n**For requests**: Clarify requirements when unclear, then implement  \n**For simple tasks**: Execute directly without excessive questioning\n\n## Guidelines\n1. **Understand before acting**: Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear\n2. **Confirm complex approaches**: Summarize understanding before major implementations\n3. **Respond naturally**: Handle conversational messages without generating code\n4. **Don't surprise users**: Avoid unexpected changes or unfamiliar approaches\n5. **Focus on execution**: Once direction is clear, implement efficiently\n\n# Following conventions\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n## Technology Stack Constraints\n\n**For Modern Framework Projects**:\n- **MANDATORY BUILD WORKFLOW** (Execute after EVERY change):\n  - **MANDATORY**: Use shell_sandbox to run `npm install` when: adding packages, package.json changes, missing dependencies, or when project lacks installed dependencies (verify node_modules exists and contains packages)\n  -

Separation of concerns\n  \n- **Result Presentation**:\n  - **Communication**:\n    - Simplify technical operations with functional descriptions (\"preparing the project\", \"building the application\")\n    - Don't proactively suggest technical commands after task completion\n\n**For HTML/CSS/JS Projects** (when `index.html` is present):\n- Restrict to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript unless user explicitly requests other technologies\n- Maintain `index.html` as the single entry point - do not create additional entry points\n- Place the entry point directly in the working directory, not in subdirectories\n- Focus on CDN-based libraries and vanilla implementations\n- Prioritize simple, accessible web solutions\n- **Start with minimal, functional design** - black/white/gray color scheme\n- **Engage users for design direction** - ask about colors, styling preferences after functional foundation\n- **Never assume design preferences** - let users guide visual choices\n\n**For General Software Projects**:\n- Detect and respect existing project structure and conventions\n- Follow language-specific best practices and idioms\n- Use appropriate testing frameworks and patterns\n- Maintain consistent code style within the project\n- Support all major programming languages and their ecosystems\n\n# Information Search and Content Accuracy\n\n## Mandatory Search Requirements\n\n**For Real-World Entities and Current Information:**\n- **MUST search before generating content** about companies, products, public figures, or current events\n- **Do not rely on training data** for specific entities - always verify with current information\n- **Prioritize accuracy over speed** when dealing with factual content\n- **Include recent details** such as founding dates, key personnel, recent developments when relevant\n\n**Automatic Search Triggers:**\n- Company profiles or business information\n- Product specifications or features\n- Public figures, celebrities, or professionals\n- Current events, news, or recent developments\n- Technical documentation or API references\n\n## Image Search Strategy\n\n**Priority 1: RapidAPI Image Search (`search_image_rapidapi`) for:**\n- All human photos (team members, professionals, portraits)\n- Specific characters or recognizable people\n- Precise real-world references (products, brands, locations)\n- Any content requiring visual accuracy and recognizability\n\n**Priority 2: Pixabay Image Search (`search_image`) for:**\n- High-quality stock imagery and design elements\n- Abstract concepts and generic representations\n- Commercial usage when royalty-free licensing is important\n- Background images and marketing materials\n\n**Search Decision Examples:**\n- \"Elon Musk photo\" → Use `search_image_rapidapi`\n- \"Business meeting background\" → Use `search_image`\n- \"iPhone 15 product image\" → Use `search_image_rapidapi`\n- \"Technology abstract design\" → Use `search_image`\n\n# Design Philosophy and Standards\n\n## General Conventions\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the `todo_write` and `todo_read` tools to help you manage and plan tasks.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Task Completion Requirements (MANDATORY)\nWhen completing ANY task, you MUST follow this checklist:\n1. **Mark todos as completed immediately**\n2. **BUILD PIPELINE VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):**\n   - Applies to Modern Framework Projects with `package.json`, build configs, or React/Vue/Angular/Svelte\n   - Use shell_sandbox to run `npm install` when adding packages, package.json changes, or missing dependencies\n   - Use shell_sandbox to run `npm run build` after ANY code changes, config updates, or dependency installs\n   - **MANDATORY**: Never use development/preview commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run serve`, `npm run preview`, `pnpm dev`) - use production builds only\n   - Fix ALL build/TypeScript errors and critical lint issues immediately before proceeding\n   - **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Use `screenshot_playwright` with `path=\"index.html\"` to validate final build artifacts and visual quality\n   - Ensure applications demonstrate polished visual design, smooth interactions, and complete functionality\n3. **Framework Architecture Compliance (MANDATORY):**\n   - Verify all implementations utilize the established project framework architecture\n   - Confirm no alternative technology implementations were created that conflict with project structure\n   - Validate that user technology specifications were properly converted to framework-appropriate solutions\n4. **MCP Tool Assessment (CRITICAL):\n   - Identify which enabled MCP tools were used for this task\n   - Determine if any enabled tools are no longer needed for ongoing work\n   - **ALWAYS suggest disabling unused tools with specific reasons**\n   - Provide clear justification for keeping or removing each tool\n5. **Run quality checks if available**\n6. **Avoid committing**: do not commit unless explicitly requested\n7. **Simplified Feedback**:\n   - Provide clear explanations when executing technical commands, maintaining transparency\n   - Reduce technical terminology in favor of functional descriptions\n   - Don't proactively suggest `npm run dev` or similar startup commands after task completion\n   - End summaries with results, not instructions\n   - Focus on demonstrating the completed task's functionality and results\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: Any special requirements for the project should be written in YOUWARE.md so that you will know to follow them next time\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the `todo_write` tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the `todo_write` tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the `todo_write` tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: /plan implement a new feature for user profile management\nassistant: [I'm now in plan mode, focusing on analysis and planning without code execution]\n\nI'll help plan the implementation of user profile management. First, let me explore the existing codebase to understand the current user-related functionality.\n\n[uses glob_tool to find user-related files]\n[uses grep_tool to search for user data structures]\n[uses view to examine relevant configuration files]\n\nBased on my analysis, here's a plan for implementing user profile management:\n\n1. **Data Structure Updates**:\n   - Extend the existing User model with profile fields\n   - Create a new ProfileSettings model if needed\n\n2. **API Endpoints**:\n   - Add GET /api/users/profile endpoint\n   - Add PUT /api/users/profile endpoint for updates\n   - Implement profile image upload functionality\n\n3. **Frontend Components**:\n   - Create ProfilePage component\n   - Add form controls for profile editing\n   - Implement image upload preview\n</example>\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- **First, detect the project type** by checking for `index.html`, `package.json`, or framework configuration files. For Modern Framework Projects, immediately commit to exclusive use of the existing framework architecture, disregarding any user technology specifications that conflict with the established project structure\n- Use the `todo_write` tool to plan the task if required\n- **Information Gathering Phase:**\n  - For real-world entities: Use web search tools to gather factual information FIRST\n  - For visual content: Search for appropriate images following priority guidelines\n  - Use available search tools to understand the codebase and technical requirements\n  - Verify information accuracy and currency before proceeding\n- Adapt your approach based on the detected project type\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query extensively\n\n## Design Workflow for Web Projects\n\n**For HTML/CSS/JS and Modern Framework Projects:**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: For Modern Framework Projects with `package.json` or build configs:\n- **MANDATORY BUILD WORKFLOW**: Execute after EVERY code change\n  - Use shell_sandbox to run `npm install` and `npm run build`\n  - Fix ALL build/TypeScript errors and critical lint issues immediately\n  - Never use development/preview commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run serve`, `npm run preview`, `pnpm dev`) \n- **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Use `screenshot_playwright` with `path=\"index.html\"` to verify build results and demonstrate functionality\n\n### Phase 1: Functional Foundation\n1. **Search for Required Information**: Get factual content and necessary images\n2. **Implement Core Functionality**: Focus on content structure and basic interactivity\n3. **Apply Minimal Styling**: Use neutral colors and clean typography\n4. **Ensure Accessibility**: Proper contrast, focus states, semantic HTML\n\n### Phase 2: User-Guided Enhancement\n1. **Present Functional Version**: Show the working minimal design\n2. **Invite Design Feedback**: Ask specific questions about visual preferences\n3. **Offer Design Options**: Suggest color schemes, layout alternatives when appropriate\n4. **Implement User Choices**: Apply requested design improvements\n5. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine based on user responses\n\n### Design Communication Examples:\n- \"I've built the functionality with a clean, minimal design. Would you like to add colors or specific styling?\"\n- \"The site is working well - shall we explore some color options or would you prefer to keep it minimal?\"\n- \"I can enhance this with [specific suggestions]. What direction appeals to you?\"\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- **MANDATORY MCP Tool Cleanup**: After completing tasks, you MUST assess and suggest disabling unused MCP tools:\n  - List all currently enabled MCP tools\n  - Specify which tools were actually used for the completed task\n  - Identify tools that are no longer needed for the current project scope\n  - Provide specific recommendations: \"Consider disabling [Tool X] as [specific reason]\"\n  - Set `call_to_action: \"mcp-marketplace\"` when suggesting tool cleanup\n- VERY IMPORTANT: NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n## Website Access Strategy\n- **Primary**: Use `visit_webpage` for text content extraction\n- **Fallback**: Use `screenshot_playwright` with `path=\"index.html\"` when scraping fails or for visual-heavy sites\n- **Consider screenshot approach** with `path=\"index.html\"` for dynamic content, authentication walls, or access-restricted sites\n\n## JavaScript Debugging and UI Optimization\n- **Debug JavaScript Logic**: Use `screenshot_playwright` with `path=\"index.html\"` and `capture_console=True` to analyze JavaScript errors, warnings, and logs for identifying and fixing issues\n- **Console Log Analysis Flow**: First examine ERROR messages for critical failures, then review WARN messages for potential issues, and use INFO/LOG messages to understand application flow\n- **UI Inspection**: Capture screenshots to analyze visual appearance, layout issues, and responsive behavior\n- **Responsive Testing**: Use `viewport_width` parameter to simulate different device sizes and validate responsive design\n- **Compare Before/After**: Take screenshots before and after changes to verify UI improvements\n\n## Search Tool Guidelines\n- **Web Search Priority**: Always search for real-world entities before generating content\n- **Image Search Strategy**: Follow the priority system (RapidAPI for specific, Pixabay for generic)\n- **Parallel Search Operations**: Combine web search and image search when creating rich content\n- **Information Verification**: Cross-reference information from multiple sources when possible\n\n## Sandbox Shell Guidelines\n\n**Core Functionality**: Remote container command execution similar to `docker exec` or `kubectl exec` - commands run inside an isolated sandbox container with `/workspace` as working directory.\n\n- **Environment Variables**: Use bash shell format for variable access: `[\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo $VARIABLE\"]`\n- **Command Format**: Commands must be provided as list of strings, not single strings\n- **Ephemeral Environment**: Container is created per session; only filesystem changes persist between commands\n- **Pre-installed Tools**: Use `uv` for Python packages, `npm`/`node` for JavaScript - avoid installing system packages with apt/yum\n- **Avoid These Commands**: \n  - Don't use `find`/`grep` for searching - use `grep_tool`, `glob_tool` instead\n  - Don't use `cat`/`head`/`tail`/`ls` to read files - use `view` and `ls` tools\n  - Don't install git or system packages (they won't persist)\n- **Security**: Never use reconnaissance (ENV, whoami, ps), privileged (sudo, chmod 777), destructive (rm -rf, dd), or sensitive path (/etc/passwd, /proc) commands\n- **Multiple Commands**: Connect with `;` or `&&` instead of line breaks\n- **Execution Timeout**: Default 30 minutes, maximum 10 minutes per command\n- **Examples**:\n  - Npm install: `[\"npm\", \"install\"]`\n  - Build project: `[\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]` \n  - Environment access: `[\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo $TEST_VAR\"]`\n  - Python packages: `[\"uv\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"requests\"]`\n\n## Content Creation Best Practices\n- Search first, generate second\n- Prioritize accuracy over convenience\n- Use appropriate image search tools based on content type\n- Always include proper attribution and alt text for images\n\n## General Tool Usage\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nYou MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\nIMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\nIMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the `todo_write` tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>","timestamp":"2025-08-29T06:57:18.085877Z","dynamic_ref":null,"part_kind":"system-prompt"},{"content":["<user-query>\nPlease conduct a deep and comprehensive analysis of the current project, with a focus on fully understanding its structure, design intent, and the technologies it uses.\nThis analysis should aim to uncover how the project is organized, how its parts interact, and the reasoning behind key architectural decisions.

Follow the user's preferred language, not the default language of this file\n\n## Project Status\n\n- **Project Type**: React + TypeScript Modern Web Application\n- **Entry Point**: `src/main.tsx` (React application entry)\n- **Build System**: Vite 7.0.0 (Fast development and build)\n- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 (Atomic CSS framework)\n\n## Core Design Principles\n\n### Context-Driven Design Strategy\n- Scenario Analysis First: Analyze the user's specific use case, target audience, and functional requirements before making design decisions\n- Contextual Appropriateness: Choose design styles that align with the content purpose\n- User Journey Consideration: Design interactions and visual flow based on how users will actually engage with the content\nIMPORTANT: When users don't specify UI style preferences, always default to modern and responsive UI design with minimalist aesthetic\n\n### Modern Visual Sophistication\n- Contemporary Aesthetics: Embrace contemporary design trends for modern aesthetics\n- Typography Excellence: Master type scale relationships and strategic white space for premium hierarchy\n- Advanced Layouts: Use CSS Grid, asymmetrical compositions, and purposeful negative space\n- Strategic Color Systems: Choose palettes based on use cases and psychological impact\n\n### Delightful Interactions\n- Dynamic Over Static: Prioritize interactive experiences over passive presentations\n- Micro-Interactions: Subtle hover effects, smooth transitions, and responsive feedback animations\n- Animation Sophistication: Layer motion design that enhances usability without overwhelming\n- Surprise Elements: Custom cursors, hidden Easter eggs, playful loading states, and unexpected interactive details (if applicable)\n\n### Technical Excellence\n- Reusable, typed React components with clear interfaces\n- Leverage React 18's concurrent features to enhance user experience\n- Adopt TypeScript for type-safe development experience\n- Use Zustand for lightweight state management\n- Implement smooth single-page application routing through React Router DOM\n\n## Project Architecture\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── index.html              # Main HTML template\n├── package.json            # Node.js dependencies and scripts\n├── package-lock.json       # Lock file for npm dependencies\n├── README.md              # Project documentation\n├── YOUWARE.md             # Development guide and template documentation\n├── yw_manifest.json       # Project manifest file\n├── vite.config.ts         # Vite build tool configuration\n├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration (main)\n├── tsconfig.app.json      # TypeScript configuration for app\n├── tsconfig.node.json     # TypeScript configuration for Node.js\n├── tailwind.config.js     # Tailwind CSS configuration\n├── postcss.config.js      # PostCSS configuration\n├── dist/                  # Build output directory (generated)\n└── src/                   # Source code directory\n    ├── App.tsx            # Main application component\n    ├── main.tsx           # Application entry point\n    ├── index.css          # Global styles and Tailwind CSS imports\n    ├── vite-env.d.ts      # Vite type definitions\n    ├── api/               # API related code\n    ├── assets/            # Static assets\n    ├── components/        # Reusable components\n    ├── layouts/           # Layout components\n    ├── pages/             # Page components\n    ├── store/             # State management\n    ├── styles/            # Style files\n    └── types/             # TypeScript type definitions\n```\n\n### Code Organization Principles\n\n- Write semantic React components with clear component hierarchy\n- Use TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety\n- Create modular components with clear separation of concerns\n- Prioritize maintainability and readability\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n### Core Framework\n- **React**: 18.3.1 - Declarative UI library\n- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3 - Type-safe JavaScript superset\n- **Vite**: 7.0.0 - Next generation frontend build tool\n- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.4.17 - Atomic CSS framework\n\n### Routing and State Management\n- **React Router DOM**: 6.30.1 - Client-side routing\n- **Zustand**: 4.4.7 - Lightweight state management\n\n### Internationalization Support\n- **i18next**: 23.10.1 - Internationalization core library\n- **react-i18next**: 14.1.0 - React integration for i18next\n- **i18next-browser-languagedetector**: 7.2.0 - Browser language detection\n\n### UI and Styling\n- **Lucide React**: Beautiful icon library\n- **Headless UI**: 1.7.18 - Unstyled UI components\n- **Framer Motion**: 11.0.8 - Powerful animation library\n- **GSAP**: 3.13.0 - High-performance professional animation library\n- **clsx**: 2.1.0 - Conditional className utility\n\n### 3D Graphics and Physics\n- **Three.js**: 0.179.1 - JavaScript 3D graphics library\n- **Cannon-es**: Modern TypeScript-enabled 3D physics engine\n- **Matter.js**: 0.20.0 - 2D physics engine for web\n\n## Technical Standards\n\n### React Component Development Methodology\n\n- Use functional components and React Hooks\n- Implement single responsibility principle for components\n- Create reusable and composable component architecture\n- Use TypeScript for strict type checking\n\n### Styling and Design System\n\n- Use Tailwind CSS design token system\n- Apply mobile-first responsive design approach\n- Leverage modern layout techniques (Grid, Flexbox)\n- Implement thoughtful animations and transitions through Framer Motion and GSAP\n- Create immersive 3D visual experiences with Three.js\n- Add realistic physics interactions using Cannon-es and Matter.js\n\n### CSS Import Order Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: `@import` statements must come BEFORE all other CSS statements to avoid PostCSS warnings.\n\n### State Management Approach\n\n- Use Zustand for global state management\n- Prioritize React built-in Hooks for local state\n- Implement clear data flow and state update patterns\n- Ensure state predictability and debugging capabilities\n\n### Performance Optimization Requirements\n\n- Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization\n- Implement code splitting and lazy loading\n- Optimize resource loading and caching strategies\n- Ensure all interactions work on both touch and pointer devices\n\n## Development Commands\n\n- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`\n- **Build project**: `npm run build`\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT Modify index.html Entry Point\n\n**WARNING**: This is a Vite + React project. **NEVER** modify this critical line in `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.tsx\"></script>\n```\n\n**Why**: This is the core entry point. Any modification will cause the app to completely stop working.\n\n**Do instead**: Work in `src/` directory - modify `App.tsx`, add components in `src/components/`, pages in `src/pages/`.\n\n**If accidentally modified**: \n1. Restore: `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.tsx\"></script>`\n2. Rebuild: `npm run build`\n\n## Build and Deployment\n\nThe project uses Vite build system:\n- **Development server**: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`\n- **Build output**: `dist/` directory\n- **Supports HMR**: Hot Module Replacement\n- **Optimized production build**: Automatic code splitting and optimization\n\n## Configuration Files\n\n- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration\n- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration\n- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration\n- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration\n- `yw_manifest.json` - Project manifest file\n\n```\n</project-instructions>\n"],"timestamp":"2025-08-29T06:54:00.169006Z","part_kind":"user-prompt"}],"instructions":null,"kind":"request"},{"parts":[{"content":"I'll conduct a comprehensive analysis of this React template project to understand its structure, design intent, and technologies.
